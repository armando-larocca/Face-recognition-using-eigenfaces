# Face-recognition-using-eigenfaces
Armando La Rocca, Pierluigi Compagnone

The main goal of this homework is to solve and analyze the face recogni- tion problem. The proposed solution is based on the Principal component analysis. This strategy applied on the proposed problem is also known as Eigenfaces method.
Two possible solutions are proposed based on the PCA and the 2DPCA, in order to solve gray-scale faces recognition and color faces recognition tasks. This methods are combined with a simple distance based classifier to achieve the face classification problem.
The last part is dedicated to the analysis and the comparison of the results obtained on a specific dataset constructed from the Pain dataset.
